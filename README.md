# anonymous-chat
Anonymous, private, and uncensored expression for all!

# What is this project all about?
In summary, this project is for everyone who believes in freedom of speech and expression. The cost of privacy should be free, messages should be uncensored, and identity anonymous.

I was motivated to start this project despite my busy schedules because of the following facts:

1. Did you know most social media keep records of all your chats after you delete them? 

2. Did you know that there is a limit to freedom of speech on most platforms?

"For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others." - Nelson Mandela. However, social media partners and the government do not respect our privacy, freedom, and anonymity.

Lastly, if you can still poop in your toilet without being spied, then you must be able to send those private messages without being monitored! Howbeit, this project is not meant to be used for illegal purposes or infringe on the freedom of others.
